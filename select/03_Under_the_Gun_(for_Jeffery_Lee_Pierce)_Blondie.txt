I still can picture him
His hands in his back pockets
He wasn't much for words
But when the wise kids made a racket
He just had to go downtown
Throw his weight around
Force starting over
Say, did you hear that con I play
Some guys I know from LA
We're on the Rio Grande
I'll pay you back next Friday
You know it sure ain't hay
Just some cat's eye day
They said they knew the way
Oh, desperado
Why don't you spend your life
In Colorado
A restless shadow
Out in the blue hills
You're feeling hollow
Oh El Diablo
Why did you spend your life
In California
I should have warned ya
No place to go now
For falling over
Some guys can't make it on the run
