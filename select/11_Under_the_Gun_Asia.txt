As the world is caving in
From the pressures of the day
And you feel that you can't win
But you know you'll have to stay

We have to toe the line
It's so hard to take the pace
You're a better man that I
In the perfect human race

So... we live... Under The Gun...
We live... Under The Gun.

See the writing on the wall
In the city's caves of steel
Hear the echoes of the night
Will the anger ever heal?

So... we live... Under The Gun...
We live... Under The Gun... we live...
Under The Gun... we live...

Your mind control, your gift of lies
You brother, dear we're screaming
You said you cared, we needed you
You mother, now you're leaving

So... we live... Under The Gun...
We live... Under The Gun...
We live... Under The Gun... we live...
Under The Gun...
